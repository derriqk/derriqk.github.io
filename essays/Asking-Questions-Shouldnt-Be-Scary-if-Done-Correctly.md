When tackling difficult situations, it’s important to remember that it’s completely normal to have questions. Not everyone can do things on their own and definitely not when it comes to technical problems in the field of computer science. Even more so, one shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions to help guide them towards their success. 

#### When asking questions, think of it this way:

Perhaps you aren’t the only one with that problem and question. Another thing, when getting answers from a community, you’ll get to see every point of view when everyone answers together. Overall, it is one big learning experience for everyone involved. 

However, one should go about searching for questions in a smart and efficient way, as well as a way that is helpful so that no one wastes their time and effort. 

One of the communities this essay will highlight is the forum-type page known as Stack Overflow. Here, there are countless experts of almost any aspect in the field and a great place to search for answers.

#### A post that demonstrates a great way to ask questions:

*One example that highlights great approaches to asking a question can be found here:* [post](https://stackoverflow.com/beta/discussions/79162321/is-having-multiple-tables-with-the-same-structure-generally-a-bad-design-choice)

To sum up this post, this user has some concerns about their current way of managing their database. In this case, it's about updating and managing various versions of releases stored in an indexed table. They question multiple things such as if their way is inefficient or common practice. They also ask if it would be okay to use one big table and if their old approach would be less speed in performance, or if there’s any pros and cons to their original approach. 

As for why it is a great post is because for one, the author split up the post into relevant sections. First is context on their situation. For instance, they say that with every release they make, it gets its own table and they add elements to the database to help track and use the information. 

The next section would be to show their reasonings for their design, such as saying that it is easier to maintain and debug each release with the tables as well as finding, deleting, and resetting them. 

These sections demonstrate the author has put in their own effort into their work and isn’t just here looking for answers, thus making this post seem worthwhile to be involved in. This can be seen more at the end of the post where the author did state they tried looking for solutions and answers before and only ended up with mixed results. The fact that the author acknowledged the mixed results means they take into consideration the meaning of everyone’s answers. Now they are here to look further into more clarifications. 

As for the questions themselves, they are great too because they are specific for their situation. They all revolve around the context of their situation and ask questions that would help with it. 

The responses to this post is proof that asking this way does get great results. For instance, one user responded that their approach doesn’t seem efficient considering large tables with large indexes will be hard to perform great on. They also added the fact that their whole approach could be wrong. If the author hadn’t mentioned their current approach and reasoning, such a response wouldn’t have existed. 

#### What happens if the posts aren’t as great:

*A post that demonstrates a bad approach to asking questions can be found here:* [post](https://stackoverflow.com/beta/discussions/77194833/what-are-the-best-architecture-approach-for-mobile-development-regardless-of-pla)

Now, on the same website, there are also bad ways to ask questions that will get little to no interactions and will make getting an answer that much harder. 

To sum this post up, this user simply asks for a link to a repository for “the best practices of clean architecture for mobile-specific domains” that they can look over. Right after they end their post with “Templates of clean code on flutter is required!” 

Overall, there are three reasons as to why this isn’t so great. 

First, this author showed no effort in searching for the answers themselves. Asking for a link seems repetitive when one could just search the question itself and see the many links that would pop up as a result. 

Second, their questions aren’t specific at all. For instance, the phrase “clean architecture” is very vague considering there are many aspects to architecture in this context. 

Lastly, the last part of the discussion could come off as demanding especially in a place where all help is free and voluntary. 

This user did not show politeness, willingness to work on things themselves, and just a lack of effort in the post. This post would not get the best results. 

This can be seen in the responses to this post as users would respond by saying that such things depend on other factors. The responses are open ended and don't really answer anything specific.

#### Key takeaways from these posts:

After looking over these posts, and many more as I searched the web for examples, there are some great points to remember when asking questions online. 

One thing is that context is everything. You can’t expect good answers if the questions come from nowhere. It’s great to apply the solution to something, such as a goal, so providing where the solution will go is great at giving context. It is also great to say anything you have tried to give some sort of base that shows you have attempted to work and aren’t being lazy. Afterall, no one wants to give free help to someone who just looks for answers with no effort. 

Second is that specific questions lead to specific answers. If there are open ended questions that there are almost no right answers, the discussion is just a waste of time. Answers will vary greatly because of how open-ended the question is so it helps no one. It helps neither the author or anyone who stumbles upon the post to help themselves. 

There are other key things such as general manners when asking strangers for help, being polite and respectful, posting on topic, and many more. 

Following these guidelines will ensure that anyone will have a great experience when in discussions, whether you are the one with the questions or the one answering, or even the bystander who came across the post in the future.
