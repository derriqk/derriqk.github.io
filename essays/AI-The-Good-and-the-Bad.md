### Some Context:

AI plays a big role in education for students, so much so that there’s constant debate on whether or not it should even be used at all. However, I truly believe that it is very helpful when used the right way. 

As for its relevance to Software Engineering, I have personally seen both the good and the bad using tools like ChatGPT and Co-Pilot while working. It is great at clarifying topics, verifying understanding of class concepts, help guide, and many more. 

However it is also wrong many times. Especially when it has zero to little context and bases its answers on assumptions. Before accepting anything from AI, you yourself still have to know and understand what kind of answers you are accepting or else things could turn out way different than you accepted.

Throughout the semester in ICS 314, I was able to experience using AI and have seen flaws and also their benefits. 

### Just What Did I Use it for Exactly? 

WODs, which were the workout of the day, aimed to be covering exactly what resources we learned for that module. To not pass the WOD simply meant the information escaped you. 

<strong> Online Experience WODs: <strong>
For experience WODs I never used AI. Most of the time the experiences had corresponding video tutorials done by the professor which I felt is much more trustworthy than AI. 

I also did the experience myself first before looking at the solutions so I can still challenge myself, or maybe even surprise myself that I was able to do the experience on my own. I found this beneficial to any in-person WODs because by knowing 90% of the topic myself, using AI to solve specific problems would not be a problem rather than relying on AI for 100% of the process. 

It can definitely be a slower process only using the resources given prior to the WOD, but I know it will make my understanding that much better. 

In-class Practice WODs:
Knowing it was a practice WOD, I figured what is the point of AI if it was practice. I found these WODs a great way to assess my own knowledge and understanding without costing my grade. If I was confused about something, I would look up examples instead of prompting AI. 

It definitely benefited me because when it came to the proper WODs that were both timed and graded, I found myself breezing through most of it until I absolutely could not remember what the right solution was. Using AI at that point saved me time without costing my own understanding throughout most of the process. 

In-class WODs:
For the first half of the WODs, when it was just the fundamentals, I didn’t use AI. I knew the cost of using AI would be sacrificing my understanding of the fundamentals even though using it would have always given me a passing grade.
As for the second half when it was making websites, AI such as copilot did come in handy. I knew what I wanted my page to look like, but knowing the exact keywords would be hard to find on my own. 

I didn’t hesitate to use what was suggested when I was stuck at a point because I was able to see in real time how my page would look afterwards. By doing this, I saved myself time and the more I saw the same keywords and styling, the more I was able to do things on my own. 

Apart from WODs, there were more general concepts in the class that AI would be applied to.

Essays:
Using AI for my essays was extremely useful especially when some essays were based on topics I barely understood. For instance, an essay requiring me to look up outside sources on Stack Exchange to identify smart questions. A lot of the topics discussed on the forums were definitely new to me. AI was able to clarify and even tell me whether or not my summary of the concept showed I understood it. 

Some of the prompts I asked were, “Tell me what this person is asking about” and also “So, is this what this person meant: [my own summary] and tell me if I understood.”

Final project
For the final project, my use of AI varied. It could be accepting a simple CSS suggestion from Co-pilot and figuring it looked nice, or prompting for complete code because it was a completely uncovered topic in class. 

I knew that we had most of the resources to do everything on our own, so I wanted to make sure I can learn by myself and do it on my own, and only using AI when it was the last resort. 

One thing that I used AI for was making an interactive search filter. It was completely new in the sense that it required writing a route, reading from the url, and then remapping the contents.

An example of a prompt I asked was “How do I make this form control interactive?”

It definitely took some time to get everything working afterwards, and it did give a really great result. However I still find it something I will need to do many more times before being able to do it on my own. 

Learning a concept / tutorial:
I never really used AI to prompt something like “explain [topic] for me.” However, the way I do use it is “This is my understanding of [topic], tell me if I understand it conceptually”.

By doing this, I can retain the information better because it is based on my own understanding, rather than getting a solution and accepting it.

Answering a question in class or in Discord:
If I gained a valuable solution from AI and it worked for me and find that others are going through the same problem, I will tell others what I did and what worked for me. However, I always hesitate to answer because I find that solutions that work for some may not work for others due to personal devices and systems varying. 

It is beneficial in the way that it saves so much time instead of trying to figure out why the problem is happening, but if future problems arise, I find myself going back to AI to help with those solutions. Only when I’ve dealt with similar problems many times or exactly the same problems can I solve them without AI. 

Asking or answering a smart-question:
I don’t use AI when asking a question because I realized some questions may require context that isn’t within AI’s scope. For instance, if it is a question about class assignments and due dates, it is just something AI can’t help me with. It would be much better to rely on my peers and professors. 

Coding examples:
When it comes to functions, I found it hard reading so much of the documentations and syntax that I over complicate things. By using AI to give a simple example, especially how it is called and with what parameters and the values it returns, that gave me all the info I really needed to use on my own. Especially with JavaScript and how functions can be so diverse, it can get confusing at times. It definitely saves me time and once I see the example, I can usually reread the documentation and then finally grasp the concept. 

Explaining code
Before using AI to tell me what some code means, I like to try and figure it out myself first. I feel this benefits me as a programmer so that I know the type of logic that went behind why this code was written. 

However, like any language, some syntax or variables that are imported aren’t always understandable unless you have prior knowledge or spend time with documentation. Using AI to explain things like those can save me so much time and confusion, and once those confusing points have been clarified, I can then fully understand the code myself and still learn. 

Some questions I have prompted were, “What does await mean?” or “What does promise do?”

Writing code
I think using AI for writing code is fine as long as I understand what is happening. Whenever I see a suggestion made by AI, I always read to see if it makes sense and if it is correct. I feel that it doesn’t take away the cost of learning because I still always make sense of everything. I feel it saves not only time, but also makes it efficient when I know what end result I want, but the specifics might not be within my memory. 

Documenting code
As for documenting code itself, I also don’t find much use in using AI. I feel it is much more beneficial for me when I can write the documentation myself to show that I understand what is happening. It is much more effort for sure, but it will solidify the things I am learning even more for myself. 

Quality assurance
Quality assurance was also made much easier with AI. There's no doubt that error popups can be as simple as one line, or can be multiple lines all with complex symbols and text that requires way more understanding. 

By simply asking “Terminal just told me this [error], what could I do?” I was able to solve problems without all the necessary knowledge. Now, especially with the more common errors, I know what to do without asking so it has definitely helped in that regard. Even with AI finding a solution can still be very frustrating, so I can only imagine what not using AI would feel like. 

### How Did it Impact Me? 

With all that being said, just how did it influence my learning overall? Perhaps the best thing I have been able to use it for would be similar to a tutor. I don’t simply prompt the entire assignment instructions and copy the answer and call it a day, that would be detrimental to my learning. Instead, I first like to tackle the problems myself first. Then as I slowly work through the problem, verify with AI that I’m doing the right thing. By constantly doing things on my own first, I still develop my own skills, almost like a form of active recall while verifying I am right along the way. 

### AI Beyond This Class:

AI is more than just prompting assignment questions though, and is definitely more than just within this class. For example, the use of AI has been used in recognition software. Whether this is as simple as a face scan, or entire vehicles running on obstacle and road detection. AI has been a place of constant innovation, but aso debate and doubts. Nonetheless, AI has been able to save time and be effective when used correctly. 

## AI: Its Challenges and Opportunities: 

As for me, AI has given me some challenges. For instance, it isn’t always correct when giving answers or suggestions. Sometimes I find that it also over complicates simple solutions. This is why I feel it is important to know what you are doing and resist the urge to constantly prompt AI. A way to integrate AI use in software engineering education can be to have experiences that cover all the pros and cons of AI. For instance, one experience can be showcasing all the AI tools and what they are best used for, and another experience listing how relying on AI can impact your own understanding. Once everyone gets a sense of AI and how to use it responsibly, it can be easily integrated into the system. 

## AI vs. Traditional Teaching:

Now, how does it compare with traditional teaching methods? For one, traditional teaching methods are always safe. By ‘safe’ I mean that you can never go wrong trusting whatever is being taught. To teach wrong would contradict the purpose of teaching the course. It would be relevant to the course as well. Engagement and skill development is also something that can be worked on for both the professor and the student. Communication would go both ways and both can benefit. 

As for AI, sure it may be correct most of the time, but it can also be complicated and go beyond the scope of the class. It is also mainly up to the student to make sure they can retain information and still learn while using AI. 

## Future Considerations:

Looking ahead, I can see two ways AI could play a role in education in software engineering. One, it can continue to be helpful for those who use it responsively. It can become very effective to the point where courses can ditch basic lessons and even make most lectures entirely up to AI for students to learn on their own. 

Another possibility is that it only gets worse in terms of competence for everyone involved. This could happen if people don’t use it responsibly and begin relying on it blindly. 

There are definitely many in between scenarios already happening, and simply removing it would be such an option either. The best way to improve would be to just start accepting it while also bringing awareness to everything it can cause, good and bad. 

## My Takeaways:

Overall, I believe that it hasn’t hindered my learning as a student despite all the bad it could cause. I know that I am using it honestly and that I don’t blindly follow it either. It is really great that using AI can be totally controlled by the student to benefit them in the way that helps them most. 

As for my thoughts on how to better optimize its integration, I believe that it starts with accepting it first. Even when it isn’t accepted, people use it regardless, and I think when it isn’t allowed that is when people use it the most irresponsible way.
