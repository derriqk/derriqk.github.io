### What are Coding Standards? Some context:

Essentially, coding standards are a set of rules and guidelines one must follow when coding. By following these set of guidelines, 
it can almost always guarantee that your code will come out clean and readable. Just like any standards, they are there for a reason! 

### Why they matter: 

For one, there’s the enforced consistency with coding standards. Imagine working on a team with not just a few but possibly tens of people, 
or even more. There's no doubt that code written in that team will be passed around and used for bigger projects. Now, imagine if the code 
and the way it was written differed between everyone. That would be quite a challenge to read especially if you are so used to your style. 
With coding standards that a team follows, the style will be identical and more consistent. That makes reading others’ code more efficient 
than if everyone had their own style. 

Then, there’s the part of coding standards that make errors less common. 

For instance, using the right terms when declaring variables, such as let, var, or const, makes it less likely that things are reassigned 
and changed, or inconsistent, throughout the code. 

Another example of making errors less common is in logic errors. Think of big blocks of ifs and else statements. Or even complex while and 
for loops, with nested loops. If the way they are written is messy, reading and verifying will be difficult. However, with proper spaces 
and indentations enforced by the coding standards one follows, it’ll make following code and logic much easier, making the program less 
likely to fail when it is run. 

### My Personal Insights:

After doing some work with appliances like ESLint running in VSCode, it left me with some opinions about coding standards. 

Personally, I have yet to experience a team-based style of coding. I have only experienced making code readable enough so 
that the people I submit work to can read it. However, I can already imagine working with groups of people and knowing that 
if we all wrote the same way, it would be much easier to read. I can even remember times when friends would show me their code and 
be completely lost reading it because it was not the style I was used to. So, overall, the consistency part of coding standards 
will definitely help in big teams. 

As for actually fixing errors as they pop up, I don’t find them much of a nuisance as well. If one thinks of them as any error, such as 
spelling mistakes that pop up as you code, why not fix it along the way. In the long run it will benefit you and anyone you ever work with. 

Coding standards can be thought of as any other standards, they are there to keep things in regulation not just efficiently, but smoothly. 
Following these standards ensures that the whole experience is great for everyone.
