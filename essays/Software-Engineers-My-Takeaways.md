### Looking Back:
*Just what have I learned?*

Over the course of this semester, I have learned many new concepts and skills that allowed me to further develop myself as a software engineer. Now that it is nearing the end of this class, I can look back at all the concepts and come to the conclusion that these will benefit me beyond software engineering. 

The skills learned, although definitely gave me everything I know to create web applications, are more than that. There are many skills and practices in general that apply to much more than just the software we create. Whether that is the clean practices, the organized teamwork and coordination, the motivation and ethics behind inventions, or overall ability to create good products, these skills will help me in so many other ways. 

#### Coding Standards:

The first of these skills would be coding standards. 

In the context of software engineering, they are essentially guidelines, almost an unspoken rule to follow when coding. It is not something technical, it isn’t a new language with different syntax, it is a practice that allows readability for the code one writes. It is a style that ensures quality and makes sure that when sharing your code, it is understandable. 

These can include specific indentations, following formats, making sure there are no legal, but still messy, errors. It also includes documentation which can be commenting on the code to explain logics, or writing out documentation to explain functionality for each component.

Looking back, I can remember many times when I would check people’s work and it can be quite confusing if they had a style I was not familiar with. It was also the case when there would be huge blocks of code that had little to no comments and I would spend time understanding how it worked.

*Just how is this beneficial for any field of practice?*

When following a certain style and guide, it gives the skill of consistency. This is really important when it comes to sharing work between team members, and maintaining high quality. A place where something like this applies would be writing or proofs, where consistency and quality is key, as opposed to messy and unorganized work that isn’t fit to be shared. 

#### Design Patterns:

*Another useful skill!*

Essentially, design patterns are a way to maintain consistency as well as efficiency while working. It is the result of experiences passed through generations that gives generalized solutions to problems we might encounter.

In the context of Software Engineering, it is through using common practices and even reusing code to keep a smooth workflow. 

In this class a design pattern we all implemented for web applications was using templates. By using a template, it made sure the minimum functionality was available and required only our personal customization to make it even more complex.

However, design patterns go beyond web applications. For instance, game development. 

*How exactly?*

The observer design pattern is a way to update objects based on a change in the subscribed object. This is a useful tool for game development because so many things rely on updated objects. Whether that is the user interface health bar changing when a player takes damage, or a player’s inventory updates when an item is collected, they all are changing due to updates in the game. 

Another great pattern is the factory design pattern, which allows efficient and consistent copies of objects. This is very useful for games when reusing and spawning enemies during gameplay. If movement and design is consistent, the factory design pattern will keep the overall game consistent.

#### Ethics in Software Engineering:

Lastly, one big takeaway from this course would be the ethics in software engineering. 

In terms of technicality, this one isn’t necessarily a skill in ways of coding language and syntax, or understanding networks and project management, it is a moral responsibility.
