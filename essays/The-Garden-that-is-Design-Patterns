In almost every field of work, there lies an accumulation of generations worth of experiences. Whether that is the trial and error of various 
proofs and understanding, or the sacrifices to know what simply works and what doesn’t. 

In all cases, these experiences created a blossoming of solutions designed to solve problems encountered over time. These are design patterns: 
not exact instructions or detailed directions, but a guide.

## Picture a garden:

### The Seedless Prototype:

Now, imagine wanting a new copy of a flower. That flower has everything you desire. It has the perfect color, the sweetest scent, and attracts the best pollinators. 

What would a smart gardener do? Well, they definitely wouldn’t start from scratch and plant a new seed and hope it turns out the same. They would use a cutting from the plant. 

The problem described there was the fact that you needed a new plant that gave the same result, and the design pattern needed to solve that problem? Well, that was the cutting. 

In terms of software engineering, that would be similar to a prototype. Why start from scratch when you have a blueprint that clearly works. 

It saves so much time as well as prevents unnecessary errors when trying to figure out all the moving parts all from scratch. 

I know I saved countless hours and prevented errors by using repository prototypes. It had all the necessary functionality of a webpage, but I was still able to build on it and make 
it truly my own. That is what a prototype should be.

### The Plant Shop: Request and Get

Perhaps you wanted to expand your garden, but you didn’t know how to get the right result or have the seeds to begin with. 

However, you do have what you want in mind such as needing a vibrant flower to attract more pollinators, and that it should be safe for pets because you happen to have a dog who 
loves to rummage through the plants. 

What would be the logical thing to do? Go to a plant shop of course! 

Think of the clerk to be the constructor, and your request to be the input. You give them what you want and then it’s all up to them. You do not have to worry about how it works, 
what happens, and what you have to do. You just know what you ask for is what you get. (Though if you actually bought a plant you may need to pay!)

That is the beauty of a factory design pattern. 

You didn’t need to know the way to create something, you simply requested it and got exactly what you needed. That is what a factory should do for you.

Once again you did not need to start from scratch and again it was as simple as using already existing things. 

As a bonus, if you started from a seed you didn’t have to wait days, or even weeks to even see a sprout, you just got the plant itself from the factory. 

In terms of software engineering, using a factory design pattern can hide so much of the unwanted process when all you have to do is give it the initial data to base it off of. 

This is exactly what I’ve done in so many projects and even the more basic ones. It can be as creating an object type and then using constructors to create more of them, or as 
complicated as creating many objects that all depend on each other, yet still functions the way you wanted without recreating everything. 

## So What?

With these specific design patterns in mind, you can see just how much it can help when working efficiently. Why trouble yourself with unnecessary work when solutions could already exist.

Just like a garden that flourishes when using the accumulated skills and research to give you the best results, software can be the same way when we reuse the right tools 
and patterns. Design patterns aren’t always shortcuts, but have proven itself to work many times because why would we keep it otherwise?
