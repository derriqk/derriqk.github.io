# Software Engineering is More than Just Code

*sample text*

## Where my passion comes from: 

To me, software engineering is more than just coding, it is also art. My interest in the creative design of websites always intrigued me. Growing up, I loved all forms of art, whether it was traditional, abstract and open to interpretation, or digital and presentable. I found myself always putting the effort in presentations that I would show to others, or submit as work. While working, I feel I could imagine the end result, following the process, and constantly editing until it could be great enough to present and I would be proud of it. 

Software engineering has that same motivation for me. I want to design software that not only I could be proud of, but anyone who comes across it would be proud too. I believe that applications should also be very convenient and understandable for anyone using it. Considering I was born and raised in a time where technology was most prominent, I understand what itâ€™s like using the internet, browsing through websites, and all its struggles. I want to be part of that contribution to make applications understandable, convenient, all the while pleasing to look at.
