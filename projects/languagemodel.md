summary: "This uses multiple class files to build a program. This program holds individual words in a linked list. Each word on the linked list has its own linked list of words that follow it and the amount of that word. By using the list and the frequency, it uses Math.random() based on the frequency to generate text."

  This project was done for my intro to programming class in my freshman year. The purpose of this project was to apply most of what I learned 
  from the course into a program. This was a solo project so only contributors were me. The project essentially creates an array list of type 
  Flight and is populated by the subclasses. Then, read a text file and compare the populated array with the information on the file. Print 
  statements were made on whether the text had a flight number or not. 

  Overall, this project was a great way to learn and understand the key concepts from the course. I was able to learn the idea of superclass, 
  subclasses, and datafield visibility as well as using keywords like private and extend. In the methods, I also learned about constructors, 
  parameters, the key word 'this,' and to use the super() function. 
  As for the file reading, it also taught me iterating through an array, the concept of using an array of type superclass to hold subclass 
  objects, using dot notation to get data field values, and try-catch statements and scanner for file input.
  Everything else, like basic declaration, initialization, object creation using key words like 'new,' etcetera, was also applied to this project.
