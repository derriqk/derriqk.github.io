  Overview:
  
    This project was meant to help refresh my skills in C++ as well as do more practice with concepts such as object oriented programming, input/output, 
    as well overall functional programming. 

  What I learned:
  
   As a result of this project, I am now more confident in object referencing, classes and functional programming, as well as getting more comfortable
   in things like cout and cin, as well as fail states for user input. 

   I also decided to try a new data structure which is Vectors, a dynamic array.
