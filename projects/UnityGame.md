summary: "This was created in the Game Dev Club for our Spring 2025 Game Jam. It was made by a team of story writers, art and music makers, and coders. I was part of the coding team and was tasked to do game level design as well as any necessary scripts."

  Overview:
  
    By using Unity Game Engine, we were able to create a 2D platformer game with a team of coders, story writers, and artists and music makers. 

  My contributions: 
  
    In this project I mainly contributed to the level designs, specifically the tutorial level and the first phase of the boss level. For each scene I also created the necessary scripts for it to run the way it is intended (of course without the assets, just the functionality.) 
    As for the cripts I made:
    Tutorial Scene: text spawner script that makes instructions appear on player collision
    Boss Phase 1: random asset selector that would later be used as a mechanism to progress through the level by hitting random chosen eggs
    
  What I learned:

    Importance of Task Management:
      By using a master worksheet, the entire club has an expected tineline and task lists as well as assigning those tasks. It helped keep organization, maintain order and ensure that everyone was able to contribute. 

    Game Development Experience:
      This experience further developed my skills in this area. 
      I was able to learn more about Unity when it comes to scene designs, game logic, C# scripting, and working with assets and components.
