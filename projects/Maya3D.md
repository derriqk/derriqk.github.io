  For this project I learned the fundamentals of Maya to be able to create, light, and animate.
  Specifically, I learned these skills:
    - Poly Modelling
    - Lighting
    - Material Customization and Assignment
    - Key Frame Animation for Objects
    - Camera/Perspective Animation
    - Motion Path Animation
