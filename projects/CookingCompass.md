  Overview:
  Cooking Compass is an application that allows UH Mānoa students to share and search for creative recipes that respect the
  constraints—limited kitchen resources, cooking skills, time—many college-goers face. By providing opportunites to find
  creative, doable recipes, this project aim to foster a community that celebrates resourcefulness, healthy eating, and the 
  joy of cooking.
