  This project involved using two C files, one for a user interface and another for the database. 
  
  The user interface involved a while loop that continues to run until the user chooses the quit option. 
  Other options included adding a record, deleting a record, printing a specific record, or printing all the records in the linked list. 
  The user could input into the terminal truncated versions of the menu options and the program would still recognize it. 
  
  The database file would be used to hold the function definitions for the menu opterations as well as initialize the head of the list. 
  It also had internal functions such as saving the list to a txt file, before deallocating all used memory when the user chose to quit. 
  When the user chose to run the program again, it would use the txt file to obtain all the details and continue smoothly.
  
  By using command-line arguments, the file also had a DEBUG option that would print extra information to ensure the program ran.
  
  This was done as for a school project for ICS 212 and it was to be done by yourself. 
  
  The whole process involved learning the project outcomes, learning the steps behind pseudocode, implenting pseudocode, and getting a gist for 
  what a testing environment would look like. 

  From this project I was able to learn many technical skills such as the fundamentals of pointers for C, the process behind allocating
  space for memory and deleting it properly. As for practical skills, I learned the importance of pseudocode and that good pseudocode captures 
  the concept and essentials of a program so that it can be implemented in any language. Another practical skill were debugging and testing. 
  I learned what it took to set up debugged print statements as well as a testing plan with expected outcomes versus actual outcomes when 
  running through the test.
